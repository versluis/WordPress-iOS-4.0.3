# WordPress for iOS 4.0.3

This is a fork of the fantastic WordPress for iOS with my own tweaks to allow images uploads in the order in which they were selected in. By default the quickest upload was inserted first. That's what I fixed here.

I had been working on this fix for a whlie, so long in fact that the project has now changed and the file in question is no longer called in the current version of WordPress. I'm explaining what I did here in this article: http://pinkstone.co.uk/how-to-add-ordered-image-uploads-in-wordpress-for-ios-4-0-3/
