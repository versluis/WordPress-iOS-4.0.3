# WordPress for iOS 4.0.3

This is a fork of the fantastic WordPress for iOS with my own tweaks to allow images uploads in the order in which they were selected in. By default the quickest upload was inserted first. That's what I fixed here.

I had been working on this for a whlie with many interruptions, so long in fact that the project has now changed and the file in question is no longer called in the current version of WordPress. I'm explaining exactly what I did in this article: http://pinkstone.co.uk/how-to-add-ordered-image-uploads-in-wordpress-for-ios-4-0-3/

I have also changed the Bundle ID to org.wordpress.dev to allow peaceful coexistence with the "real" WordPress app on the same device. Don't forget to change your Team ID before you build this fork.
